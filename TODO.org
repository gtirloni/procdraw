** TODO Version Procdraw

   Could use Semantic Versioning

   http://semver.org/

   Store the version info in the top CMakeLists.txt

   Then generate a C header file with version info that I can show in
   the program.

   https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/configure_file.html

   For pre-release, append -alpha.SOMETHING

   See SemVer 2.0 spec point 11

   For example:

   0.1.0-alpha.1234

   Maybe add +GITHASH ?

   Options for .SOMETHING:

   - timestamp of HEAD commit
   - number of commits at HEAD

   Can get the timestamp of the HEAD commit with:

   git show -s --format=%ct HEAD

   Can get the number of commits with:

   git rev-list --count HEAD

   Can get the commit hash with:

   git rev-parse --verify --short HEAD

   - See: "Prettyprinting" by Derek Oppen
     - ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems
     - Volume 2 Issue 4, Oct. 1980
     - http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=357114.357115
   - Also: "XP. A Common Lisp Pretty Printing System" by Richard C. Waters

** TODO Add binary file utils

   - New byte array data type
   - Use a hex dump for the string representation of a byte array (what
     is shown in the Transcript): offset, hex values, and ASCII
     rendering
   - (load-file filename)
     - Load a file from disk, returning a byte array
   - (strings byte-array)
     - Works like Unix strings -- returns a list of (offset, string)
       pairs for ASCII text found in the byte array

** TODO Use an image file to persist interpreter state

   - Make the image format as human readable as possible
   - Need to handle references to shared data
   - Need to handle cycles
   - Partition the global environment into collections/modules and
     store each in a separate file
     - I'm hoping this will make it easier to extract bits of an image
       for sharing
     - Start with 2 collections: user and system
     - By default a symbol is placed into the user collection
     - Add functions for getting and setting a symbol's collection
       membership

   Use a format of one dotted pair per symbol:

   (symbol1 . val1)
   (symbol2 . val2)

   Depends on:

   - [[Shared reference support and cycle detection]]
   - [[Name CFunctions]]

** TODO Update the Reader to read floating point numbers             :v0_1_0:
** TODO Update the Reader API to support reading multiple objects from one input
   <<Read multiple objects>>

   LispReader::SetInput(const std::string &str);
   LispReader::Read(LispInterpreter *L);

   These methods are implemented. I just need to remove the
   Read(LispInterpreter *L, const std::string &str) and make them
   public.

   I will need to add unit tests for multiple inputs.

** TODO Implement image frame Signals

   - Streams of bitmap images implementing the Signal interface.
   - For doing real time image processing.
   - The rendering process could be modified to act as a signal
     generator so that I could do full-screen post processing on the
     rendered images.

** TODO Efficient symbol referencing from C++

   Some options:

   - Keep the existing SymbolRef(std::string name) API but use a
     hashtable
     - std::unordered_map<std::string, LispObjectPtr>
   - String interning with a hashtable
   - A global symbol table rather than per interpreter instance --
     symbols can then be created and references stored once at program
     start
   - Use an object oriented extension API to create symbols needed by
     an extension at extension registration -- references to the
     symbols can then be stored on the extension instance and accessed
     through the callback data argument (similar to how the interpreter
     itself uses symbols -- references are stored at construction)
   - Symbol table generation at compile time
     - Mark symbols in C code with a macro
     - Make a tool which scans through and generates a symbol table
     - The symbol table is represented as an array on the interpreter
     - And the symbol macro expands to a lookup into the array

** TODO Use a shorter name for "lambda"

   Such as:

   - \ (Haskell)
   - fn (Clojure, Standard ML)
   - fun (Erlang, OCaml)
   - func (Go)

** TODO Initialise signal keys at construction

   Some syntax options:

   - (setq saw1 (saw 10))
   - (setq saw1 (saw 'freq 10))
   - (setq saw1 (saw {'freq 10}))

   Rather than

   (setq saw1 (saw))
   (put saw1 'freq 10)

** TODO Add a /=> disconnect signal function
** TODO Use Hz for oscillator frequencies

   Use Hz for oscillator frequencies rather than cycles per frame.

   Mapping Hz to cycles per frame will depend on exactly how I proceed
   with updating the signals vs rendering ('game loop'). But if I
   continue with vsync, then:

   - For windowed mode, I can get the refresh rate from DwmGetCompositionTimingInfo
   - For full-screen, IDXGIOutput::GetDisplayModeList and what is requested in DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_DESC.RefreshRate
   - Or empirically using my existing ProcdrawApp::FramesPerSecond

   See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18844654/how-to-find-out-real-screen-refresh-rate-not-the-rounded-number

   Also could set a value in the interpreter called fixed-fps and use
   that in signals to calculate update per frame from a frequency in
   Hz.

** TODO Add a for-each function

   (for-each list fun)

** TODO Add function(s) for generating ranges of numbers

   Either functions that return actual list data structures or that
   return iterators/generators that build values lazily.

   Like:

   - APL iota
   - Python 2 [[https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#range][range]]
   - Python 3 [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-range][Ranges]]
   - vvvv spreads
     - http://vvvv.org/documentation/spread-nodes
     - http://vvvv.org/documentation/linearspread-%28spreads%29

** TODO Add a mechanism for iterating over a cartesian product

   Either with a list comprehension or by building a list of all
   combinations.

   See:

   - https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.product
   - http://vvvv.org/documentation/cross-%282d%29
   - http://vvvv.org/documentation/cross-%283d%29

** TODO Add a list-length function

   See http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_list_l.htm#list-length

** TODO Add an equal function

   Which recurses into conses, comparing their components.

   See http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_equal.htm#equal

** TODO Create an extensions API
   <<Extensions API>>

   And minimise the runtime, with as much as possible structured as
   extensions.

   I have:

   - RegisterProcdrawAppFunctions() in procdraw_app_lisp.h
   - RegisterSignals() in signals.h

   Create a standard structure for expressing extensions. Maybe an
   object with a Register() function. Or an Exports() function.

   With the addition of the void *data parameter to
   LispInterpreter::SetGlobalCFunction(), I should be able to bind
   directly to the GLRenderer instance, rather than going through
   ProcdrawApp.

   First step could be to keep the use of a C function but standardise
   on a naming convention of Register<Extension name>:

   - RegisterSignals
   - RegisterGLRenderer
   - RegisterUtil

   Cleanup:

   - Remove procdraw_app_lisp.* (becomes part of GLRenderer)
   - Remove lisp_functions.*
     - The functions that are part of LispInterpreter are bound in
       LispInterpreter
     - The functions that are not part of LispInterpreter have
       Register function(s) added beside the code they bind
   - Extensions/*_ext.cc and extensions/*_ext.h

   Rename util.h to math.h and util.cc to math.cc.

   A possible object-based API:

   class Extension {
   public:
       virtual void Register(LispInterpreter &L) = 0;
       virtual ~Extension() { }
   };

   And:

   LispInterpreter::Extend(Extension &ext)
   {
       ext.Register(this);
   }

** TODO Add shared reference support and cycle detection to data structure printing and reading
   <<Shared reference support and cycle detection>>

** TODO Name CFunctions
   <<Name CFunctions>>

   When I am further with my serialization and implementation of
   image-based storage, I will need some way to name CFunctions.

   Right now, if I implement table printing, I would get something
   like this for a signal:

   { step <CFunction> }

   But which CFunction?

   Sketch of an initial idea:

   1. A hash table storing mapping from string name to function
      pointer
   2. Functions must be registered in this hash table
   3. The CFunction object includes the name in addition to the
      function pointer
   4. SetGlobalCFunction takes a name (which is looked up in table 1)
      rather than a function pointer directly
   5. When we print a CFunction we get <CFunction:NAME> or such
   6. When we read <CFunction:NAME>, we look up the table 1

   MakeCFunction would also take a name rather than a function
   pointer.

** TODO Add hex literals to the reader syntax
** TODO Add signalp

   I have a C function Signalp but it isn't yet accessible from Lisp.

** TODO Add logical operators: and, or, not

   - not [DONE]
   - and
   - or

** TODO Remove the Boolean and Null types

   And use the traditional Lisp treatment of boolean values:

   - nil is false
   - everything else is true
   - nil and t are Symbols and are self evaluating

   The not function then becomes an alias of null as they have the same
   behaviour.

   See also: [[Is Constant]]

** TODO Add an 'is constant' flag to Symbols
   <<Is constant>>

   Add an 'is constant' flag to Symbols. That determines if it's
   possible to change their value.

   Set on

   - pi
   - nil
   - t

** TODO Add a phase offset to my oscillator signals
** TODO Minimise the size of the Lisp machine core

   Minimise the size of the Procdraw Lisp machine core

   - Minimise the number of types
   - Minimise the number of functions

   I'm thinking in terms of scope something like a bytecoded virtual
   machine: data types, logic, arithmetic, lambdas, and eval.

   Move non-core functions (including read and print) to separate
   source file(s).

   See also: [[Extensions API]].

** TODO Add a lisp binding for list

   The interpreter has a list function but it is not accessible from Lisp.

** TODO Add sigmap and sigmap2 functions

   - (sigmap f signal)
   - (sigmap2 f signal1 signal2)

   Returns a new signal that applies the provided function f to the
   signal input(s).

   Can then remove the optional mapfun parameter from =>.

** TODO Add support for constant sources to =>

   If the source of a => is a signal (signalp), put a connection.
   Otherwise, set the value with put-slot and remove any existing
   connection.

** DONE Add a toggle signal type

   Inputs:

   - Event signal
   - Signal A (default to constant 0)
   - Signal B (default to constant 1)

   The value of the toggle signal is either A or B and toggles between
   them each time the input event signal is true.

   Example usage: stopping and starting an oscillation

   (=> (sigmap2 * (toggle key-space) midic-1-1) saw1 'freq)

** TODO Add a counter signal type

   Inputs:

   - incr event signal
   - decr event signal
   - min (default to 0)
   - max (default to 1)
   - incr-amount (default to 1/8)
   - wrap boolean defaults to false

   Signal value:

   - A number >= min and <= max
   - If incr, val += incr-amount
   - If decr, val -= incr-amount
   - If wrap is true, the value wraps, otherwise, it stops at the limits

** TODO JSON parser
   <<JSON parser>>
** TODO JSON serializer

   - A sound tracker like sequencer
   - Algorithmic pattern generation

** TODO Add fexprs
** TODO New Signals
*** Desired behaviour and challenges

    - Concise notation for signal value and update expressions; some
      thoughts:
      - $sig as reader macro for (sigval sig)
      - (sig) instead of (sigval sig) -- signal as callable function
      - [expr] rather than (lambda () expr)
      - "\" as new spelling for "lambda" -- (\ () expr)
    - Make update connections between things which are not generators
      (both as source and target)
      - such as updating draw colour based on a sin generator
        - (<- color 'hue (\ () $sin1))
        - (<- console-font-size [$midic-1-1])
      - or updating a sin generator frequency from the value of a
        function call (do I want this second one? that is: a source
        that is not a generator?)
    - Being able to update a generator, or processing function, bound
      to a particular name
      - for example if I did the following:
        - (<- sigtarget 'key (sigmap sigsource f))
        - sigsouce and f are looked up at evaluation of the sigmap
          call and if I later rebind sigsource or f, the update
          connection will still use the previous bindings
      - if I instead use expressions and do name lookup at update time
        (each frame say)
        - (<- sigtarget 'key (\ () (f sigsource)))
        - I can now rebind f or sigsource and the connection will use
          the new bindings
        - but it's harder to build dependency information
        - f may do its own lookup of global names -- that is: there
          may be dependencies that are within the body of f and not
          explicitly in the expression provided to <-
    - How to perform dependency updating?
      - I currently do it on a lazy pull basis -- if I ask for the
        value of a signal, I check to see if it's been updated for
        this frame; if it hasn't yet, then I evaluate any update
        expressions (and recursively this will result in dependencies
        being updated)
        - how should this interact with updates that occur within the
          draw function? (user code updates a value with a dependent)
        - if a signal generator is not evaluated for a particular
          frame, it will not be stepped
      - Another approach would be to reactively push changes through
        the system -- if a value changes that others are depending on,
        they get notifications of the change and update themselves
        appropriately
        - how should this interact with a generator that should only
          update once per frame?
      - A third approach would be to do all dependency updating at the
        start of each frame
        - similarly to the lazy updating: how should this interact
          with updates that occur with the draw function? (user code
          updates a value with a dependent)
    - Signal containment would be good to add so that when an update
      expression is evaluated, the sub-signals are searched for names
      before searching globally. Then I can have self-contained
      related signals that can be passed around, or stored in a
      collection and iterated over.
      - This could be done using explicit reference to signal members,
        such as:
        - (<- sig1 'key1 (\ (self) (sigval (get self 'subsig1))))

*** Expressions as signal generator sources

    If I use expressions as update sources, then I no longer need to
    wrap information sources in signals -- they can be variables or
    function calls.

    - mouse position
    - midi input
    - key press state

*** Implementation thoughts
**** Tables

     Add a Table type, with some strategy for stable printing (keys
     maintain their order). Either store internally as a property
     list, or as a hashtable and sort keys at print.

     - (put table 'key val)
     - (get table 'key)
     - (<- table 'key expr)
       - where expr is a lambda expression without arguments
       - for example: (<- color 'hue (\ () (sin1)))
     - a table may be called as a function
       - a special key "--call" is looked up when a table is called as
         a function (like Lua)
       - for example:
         - (put t1 '--call (\ (self b) (+ (get self 'a) b)))
         - (t1 10)

     Signals (generators?) are then implemented as tables with step
     functions as --call members.

**** Push connections ->

     (-> table 'key 'targetname)
     (-> table 'key 'target-table-name 'target-key)
     (-> table 'key 'target-table-name 'target-key expr)
